* resource in archive auto unpack
* support ipfs (it already has a http front, so adapt should be easy)
* support syncthing (it's written in Go and opensource)
* support tribler (written in python, needs libtorrent, hard to adapt.
                  maybe include binary and did a http proxy is easier)
* support btsync (close source, API needs payment. but we can use http UI
                  to emulate)
